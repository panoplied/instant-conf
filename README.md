# Instant conf

Web UI for configuration management library (yet to be implemented). The UI uses Redis to store user defined namespaces and their configuration records (simple key value pairs), which would be used by the library to provide configurations via an external server.

To launch the UI:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000
